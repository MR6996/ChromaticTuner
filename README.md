The aim of the project have been the production of an application that a musician can use for tune his instruments. 

This application use a Pitch Detection Algorithm (MPM algorithm [See references](#references)), for identify the pitch of a sound recorded by the microphone. This implementation runs in real-time recording audio signal for a small delta of time and applaying the algorithm.

The User-Interface show to the user the nearest note calculated starting from the pitch identified.

The application provides a dialog box for set the user preferences, such as:
   * the frequency of A4;
   * the input device;
   * the notation tu use for display the note.
